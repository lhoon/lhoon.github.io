					<br>
					<h4>Brief Abstract</h4>
					<p>Apps stores offer a transparent feedback loop between users and developers via public app reviews and direct distribution of updates to users. Significant effort is expended to glean useful information from reviews and to examine this feedback loop. This thesis uses statistical and text analysis on 8.7 million reviews to demonstrate that the majority of reviews, when read in isolation, do not yield developers much actionable feedback. Reviews are analysed to offer app benchmarking, search space reduction techniques and typical review properties to detect and sort useful reviews, toward informing project expectations, priorities and scoping.</p>

					<h4>Full Abstract</h4>
					<p>The App Store and Google Play are mobile app store fronts furnished with a public review system. The competition on these store fronts is intense– developers can push new releases to users directly; users can publicly express opinions on the apps they have used. The resulting transparent feedback loop, while evident to the app community, is visible to competitors as well. Studying these app reviews within a domain can inform the design of their own competing app, exploiting any prior user dissatisfaction. Thus, it behoves developers to maintain quality, in either attempts to enter this market with a new app or efforts in continuous refinement of an existing app portfolio.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>Opinion mining research has yielded observations of interest to businesses by analysing user reviews of their products. These research efforts leverage static analysis techniques and natural language processing approaches to discern generalisable patterns and analyse content. However, a good framework to mine mobile app reviews for content useful to app developers is lacking. Our work addresses this gap.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>In this thesis we demonstrate that the majority of reviews when read in isolation, do not yield developers much actionable feedback. However, using a series of analytics, we can construct a frame of context to detect developer-useful information. More specifically, our work analyses 8.7 million reviews from 17,330 apps at a store–, category– and app-level perspective. We present a statistically constructed app review model that profiles review properties, growth and evolution. A text stabilisation treatment is also offered to prepare reviews for content analysis. Through use of the model to reduce the content search space, we offer a technique to detect and sort reviews by content usefulness. Holistic application of these analytics forms an app development benchmarking framework to inform project expectations, priorities and scoping.</p>
