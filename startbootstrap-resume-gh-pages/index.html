Additionally, the display of timeline since arrival and procedures performed provided the team members critical contextual information that augments the patient's current vital signs, especially when arriving in the bay separately.</p> -->

          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
            <p>Apart from my work with product and project management, I am an avid archer and musician. In the archery arena, I'm a proud member of the <a href="http://www.bhca.net.au" target="_blank">Box Hill City Archers</a> club and currently shoot both outdoor barebow recurve and olympic target recurve.</p>
            <p>I used to be a gigging bassist and guitarist, depending on the needs of the band for the particular gig. My preference was for weekend afternoon cafe gigs. For now, I'm reinventing my technique and expanding my knowledge of music theory by taking lessons again.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy carpentry. Specifically, luthiery, which is the construction of guitars. Unfortunately, I am an apartment dweller without a garage, which puts a damper on this hobby. Besides, my free-loading house mate (she's a cat) would likely disapprove of the noise.</p>
